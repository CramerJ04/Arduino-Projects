In my embedded systems class, I not only worked with various instruments to test my embedded system knowledge, but was given the opportunity to work with a Raspberry Shake. In doing so, I was able to setup and get fully working measurements and location data hosted for a Raspberry Shake on the Whitewater campus. A Raspberry Shake collects earth movements and quakes in Hz measurements for a specific location, with the potential to detect an earthquake before it happens.
