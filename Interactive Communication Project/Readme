This project was for my interactive communication class. I created a project where an individual with a learning disability can navigate a computer with simple buttons with LED and/or sound queues. I created the project within Arduino IDE and used an Adafruit Flora kit to get the desired outcome for the project. I also laser printed housing for the buttons and wires.
